## Assignment :speech_balloon:

**_Day 3 - Modules and the Browser_**
If your code is divided between, say, 8 different files and you use JavaScript modules, the browser will have to download 8 files instead of one. Moreover, older browsers don't support modules.
For this reason (and more) most JavaScript projects these days use something called a "bundler".

A bundler is a program that you run from the command line. At its core, a bundler takes your JavaScript files, reads all the import and export declarations, and generates a single output JavaScript file (often minified) that can be natively read by any browser. Kind of like what SASS does when it turns a number of .sass/.scss files into one compressed CSS file.

You really get the best of both worlds: you can keep your code well structured and organized, and the browser can easily parse it as a single file.
